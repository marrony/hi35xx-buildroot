This is a fork of https://github.com/hi35xx/hi35xx-buildroot with an updated default configuration for the HI3518 V100 and Linux 3.0 to match those used in the blog post at https://mark4h.blogspot.com/2017/08/hi3518-camera-module-part-2-getting.html. In addition the pinmux_hi3518.sh startup script has been updated to fix a bug preventing the Ethernet from working.
